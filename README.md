## Researcher Ice Breaker

The **Researcher Ice Breaker** project is a LangChain-powered agent designed to generate personalized icebreakers for
healthcare professionals. Given a healthcare professional's **ResearchGate profile**, the agent searches ResearchGate to
find academic profiles, conference participation, and publications. It will then generate tailored icebreakers based on
the individual's research, initiatives, or affiliations.

#### Features:

- Search ResearchGate for academic profiles, publications, and other professional contributions.
- Generate personalized icebreakers for initiating conversations with healthcare professionals based on their work and
  interests.

For detailed setup, usage instructions, and API documentation, please visit
the [Researcher Ice Breaker README](./ice-breaker/README.md).
