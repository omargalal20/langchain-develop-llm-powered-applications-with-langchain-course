## Researcher Ice Breaker

The **Researcher Ice Breaker** project is a LangChain-powered agent designed to generate personalized icebreakers for
research professionals. Given a research professional's **ResearchGate Name**, the agent searches ResearchGate to
find academic profiles, conference participation, and publications. It will then generate tailored icebreakers based on
the individual's research, initiatives, or affiliations.

#### Features:

- Search ResearchGate for academic profiles, publications, and other professional contributions.
- Generate personalized icebreakers for initiating conversations with research professionals based on their work and
  interests.
