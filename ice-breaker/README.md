## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    - cd into ice-breaker:
      ``` 
      cd backend

2. **Create `.env` File:**
    - Create a `.env` file inside the `./app` directory, where it contains source code.
    - Add the following content to the `.env` file based on `.env.template`:
3. **Setup virtual environment for the project**
    - Run in terminal:
      ``` 
      uv sync
      uv lock
    - After running commands this should create a .venv folder if not:
      ``` 
      uv venv
    - Choose the local python interpreter by selecting the current virtual environment in the used IDE.
    - Choose existing not generating new one, and select the following `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.
4. **Run Project**
    - After setting up virtual environment enter the `./app` directory and run the main function in the `main.py`.

# Deployment

## Deploying with Docker (Manual)

To manually deploy the `Researcher Ice Breaker` application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t ice-breaker:${APP_VERSION} .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p ${APP_PORT}:${APP_PORT} --env-file .env ice-breaker:${APP_VERSION}
    ```

    - This will run the container in detached mode (`-d`) and map the containerâ€™s port to the specified `APP_PORT`.
    - Make sure to replace `${APP_PORT}` with the actual port you want to run the application on (e.g., `8000`).

3. **Check running container**:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

   This will show all running containers. Your container should be listed.

4. **Access the application**:
   Once the container is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:${APP_PORT}` to interact with the API.

## Deploying with Docker Compose

If you prefer to use Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:
    ```yaml
    name: langchain-course

    services:
      ice-breaker:
        container_name: ice-breaker
        build:
          context: .  # Path to the directory with the Dockerfile
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "${APP_PORT}:${APP_PORT}"  # Ensure APP_PORT is defined in your .env
        env_file:
          - .env
    ```

2. **Start the application with Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    - This will build the image (if necessary) and start the container in detached mode (`-d`).

3. **Check running container**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```

   This will show all services managed by Docker Compose. You should see the `ice-breaker` service listed.

4. **Access the application**:
   Once the container is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:${APP_PORT}` to interact with the API.

5. **Stopping the application**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

   This will stop and remove the container along with any associated networks.

### Additional Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Make sure you have the `.env` file properly configured with all the necessary environment
  variables (as described earlier in the README).
- **Application Logs**: To view the logs of the running container, you can use:
    ```bash
    docker logs ice-breaker
    ```

---

By following these steps, you can deploy and run the `Researcher Ice Breaker` application using Docker or Docker Compose
easily.
